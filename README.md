## About
Our group project from the course Agile Development, where we were tasked with creating an online store for a fictional local game store. During two sprints we achieved the following features:
- Databases for saving products and events.
- Fully functioning API built with FastEndpoints.
- Presentation layer built with Blazor
- Account handling functionality with Blazor Identity UI
- Functioning site UI built with MudBlazor.
## Background
Our group was tasked with the creation of an online presence for a local fictional game store, located in the borough of Gamlestaden in Gothenburg. Together with our project leader we worked according to SCRUM to plan and visualize the project.
